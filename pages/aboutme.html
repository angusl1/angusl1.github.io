					<p>
						I'm Angus, a third year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).
						Engineering Physics is an engineering discipline which combines aspects of computer, mechanical, and electrical engineering with mathematics and physics.
						Part of why I chose to study Engineering Physics was to demystify the technology around me.
						Growing up, I was always infatuated with the magic of technology, but there was also a desire to understand the "magic".
						With the support of UBC and EngPhys, I have been able to learn about some of the concepts in mathematics, physics, and engineering which allow our phones to run, fridges to keep our food cold, and much more.
						While there is more to learn, in the future I aim to be able to help bring the magic of technology to others.
						<link><a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">You can learn more about the program on the Engineering Physics website.</a>
						Oh right, I've been applying what I learnt in the classroom to various projects too. Check these out on my portfolio page!
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (TA for short) for APSC 160: Introduction to Computation in Engineering at UBC.
						In my position, I mainly give lab lectures with office hours after, grade, and invigilate exams.
						This is my third term as a teaching assistant (2023W Term 2) and I try to TA for the course whenever it fits into my schedule.
						I really do enjoy teaching and helping students to understand the material, and there is benefit for myself too, I've noticed is that my ability to communicate technical information has improved since I do it so much as a TA.
						Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss teaching, or have any questions!

					<h3> Hobbies and other Interests </h3>
					<p>
						Outside of my academic and career goals, I have a few hobbies and activities which I really enjoy.
						Right now, I live in Vancouver, Canada which gives me the opportunity to go out and explore the city on foot or through our amazing local public transit system.
						On these excursions I enjoy looking for a nice spot to grab some food, or shopping for ingredients to cook with.
						Back at home, I have a small collection of mechanical keyboards which I built and soldered.
						In the future, I want to CAD my own case and design my own PCB but until I improve my skills I think I will leave it to the pros.
						I also enjoy playing some multiplayer games with friends, but my latest obsession has been Riot Games' Teamfight Tactics.
						Love the autobattler style game for the analytical thinking and problem solving skills it requires along with the community's focus on statistics.
