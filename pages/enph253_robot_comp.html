				<h1>Henrietta Ford</h1>
				<p>
					In the summer of 2023, myself and three of my Engineering Physics friends took on the legendary annual EngPhys Robot Summer competition. Over the course of 12 weeks, teams would 
					design and fabricate an autonomous robot to compete in a brand new competition devised by our program's instructors. We took 5 courses in the first 6 weeks while learning
					about key robot design concepts and considerations, then spent the last 6 weeks prototyping, fabricating, and tuning our robot. It was a lot of fun, work, and here is how our team
					was able to earn 3rd place.

				<h3>Competition Overview</h3>
				<p>
					This year's robot competition was relatively simple with a couple obstacles and twists to make the competition more challenging for us such as a zipline, rocky obstacles, and an IR beacon shortcut. 
					Teams would have 2 minutes to score as many points as possible by completing full laps (3 points per) and picking up coin blocks (1 point per). 
					Teams could also lose points and be reset to the start by picking up a magnetic bomb block. 
					Width of the robots were limited by an archway on the track, but could be bypassed by taking the IR beacon shortcut across a rocky obstacle. 
				</p>
				<h3>Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					The first thing our team looked at before designing our robot was the strategy that we would use. All of the teams believed that focus on completing laps was more valuable than 
					collecting blocks for a few reasons. The value of blocks was less than the value of a lap, the number of blocks you could collect was artificially limited by the number of blocks on the course,
					and if a team got ahead at the junction they could push all of the blocks away from the tape line making it more difficult to collect them. Teams had a few unique options to complete laps
					such as taking a shortcut with the IR beacon, taking the zipline and skipping a third of the course, and jumping off the bridge to skip part of the course as well. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We decided to forego these unique options and focus on completing laps quickly by following the tape.
